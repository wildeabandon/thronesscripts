\textit{KINGS LANDING: TYRION'S ROOM} 

\ti{\TYRION ~slowly awakens, his left eye and part of his face bandaged. As he gains consciousness, he sees \PYCELLE ~standing over him.}

\TYRION: Pod. Pod! \sd{Enter \PODRICK ~} Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive. 

\PODRICK: Yes, My Lord. \sd{Exit \PODRICK.}

\PYCELLE: Would you like something for the pain? 

\TYRION: What happened? 

\PYCELLE: The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father. 

\TYRION: Where am I? 

\PYCELLE: These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King. Oh. For your trouble. 

\ti{\PYCELLE ~throws \TYRION ~a coin. Exit \PYCELLE.}

\textit{KINGS LANDING: GREAT HALL} 

\ti{Enter \TYWIN. The Great Hall is full of people, with soldiers lining a passage to the Iron Throne where \JOFFREY ~sits, and the court standing in rows behind the soldiers. At the front, stand \LORAS ~and \MARGAERY, with \VARYS ~and \PYCELLE ~on the other side, all looking up at \TYWIN ~and \JOFFREY. \CERSEI ~sits on a low seat next to \JOFFREY. \SANSA ~looks on from a balcony above, along with more of the noblewomen.}  

\JOFFREY: I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather Tywin Lannister the saviour of the city and the Hand of the King. 

\TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace. 

\JOFFREY: Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward. For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal$\ldots$ With all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time. 

\LITTLEFINGER: You honour me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons. 

\ti{General laughter.}

\JOFFREY: Ser Loras Tyrell. Your House has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it and it shall be yours. 

\LORAS: Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before$\ldots$ She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honour of joining our Houses. 

\JOFFREY: Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

\MARGAERY: With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me. 

\JOFFREY: Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, My Lady. It would be an honour to return your love, but I am promised to another. A King must keep his word. 

\CERSEI: Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councillors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside. 

\CROWD: \sd{General muttering and hubbub.} Margaery! We want Margaery! 

\JOFFREY: I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow. 

\PYCELLE: Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods. 

\JOFFREY: \sd{To the room.} The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. \sd{\LORAS ~rises. \JOFFREY ~addresses \MARGAERY ~} You will be my Queen and I will love you from this day until my last day. 

\ti{Applause from the crowd. \JOFFREY ~swaggers back to his throne. \SANSA ~walks away, smiling when out of view of the noblewomen. \LITTLEFINGER ~approaches up the stairs, from behind \SANSA.}

\LITTLEFINGER: My Lady. My sincerest condolences. 

\SANSA: They're right$\ldots$ I'm not good enough for him. 

\LITTLEFINGER: You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well. 

\SANSA: But if he's not marrying me$\ldots$  

\LITTLEFINGER: He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home. 

\SANSA: King's Landing is my home now. 

\LITTLEFINGER: Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.

\textit{KINGS LANDING: LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL} 

\ti{\ROS ~sits in front of a mirror, applying make-up to bruises on her face. The door opens, with knocking at the same time. \ROS ~looks up briefly and continues applying concealing make-up.}

\ROS: Come in. Make yourself comfortable. 

\ti{Enter \VARYS ~in a hooded cloak. He sits on the bed, and \ROS ~rises and approaches him. She doesn't yet know who he is.} 

\ROS: That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me. 

\ti{\ROS ~starts to undress, half taking off her top. \VARYS ~pulls back his hood.}

\VARYS: No need for that, my dear. 

\ROS: You sure? Most men like what they see. 

\VARYS: I'm not like most men. 

\ROS: That's what most men say. \sd{\ROS ~puts her top back on.} If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do. \sd{\ROS ~sits next to \VARYS.}

\VARYS: I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be. 

\ROS: Have we met? 

\VARYS: You wouldn't remember me if we had? 

\ROS: I meet a lot of men. 

\VARYS: And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them. 

\ROS: You're very kind, My Lord. Allow me to return the favour. 

\ti{\ROS ~reaches for \VARYSï¿½ ~groin. She pauses, withdraws, and stands.}

\VARYS: You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there. 

\ROS: I know who you are. 

\VARYS: And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other. 

\ROS: How do you know about that? 

\VARYS: I thought you said you knew who I was. 

\ROS: What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

\ti{\VARYS ~pats the bed, and \ROS ~reluctantly sits back down next to him. \VARYS ~lifts her chin with his finger.}

\VARYS: Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner. 

\ROS: I'm afraid of him. 

\VARYS: Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.

\textit{THE WESTERLANDS} 

\ti{\JAIME ~stands on a rocky stretch by the water, while \BRIENNE ~hauls in a small boat. \JAIME's ~hands are tied to a rope, which is held by \BRIENNE.}

\JAIME: You're a virgin, I take it?

\ti{\BRIENNE ~has finished with the boat, and pushes \JAIME ~ahead.} 

\BRIENNE: Walk. 

\ti{They walk up the rocky shore towards the trees.}

\JAIME: Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne. 

\BRIENNE: One or two tried. 

\JAIME: Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough. 

\BRIENNE: Not interested. 

\JAIME: Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.

\ti{\BRIENNE ~looks up at three women hanging from a branch of a tree. Around the neck of the middle woman is a sign, reading: `THEY LAY WITH LIONS'.}

\JAIME: Ah. They lay with lions. Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks. 

\BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. 

\JAIME: Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams. What are you doing? 

\ti{\BRIENNE ~pushes \JAIME ~forcefully towards a tree, and ties him up.}

\BRIENNE: Burying them. 

\JAIME: We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river. I think these women would understand if$\ldots$  

\BRIENNE: \sd{Approaching the women.} I don't care what you think. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: \sd{Offstage.} I didn't leave it here. 

\JAIME: \sd{Quietly, to \BRIENNE.} Untie me now. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: \sd{Offstage.} I gave it to you to cut the rope, and
now I don't have me dagger no more. So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone
$\ldots$ \sd{enter 2 \textbf{STARK SOLDIERS}} Whoa! What's your
business here?

\BRIENNE: Travelling a prisoner. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: \sd{Laughing uproariously.} You're a woman. A woman!

\STARKSOLDIERb: Well, fuck me! 

\BRIENNE: If you've quite finished up$\ldots$ \sd{\textbf{STARK SOLDIERS} start laughing again.} All right, we'll be going. \sd{\BRIENNE ~walks towards \JAIME.} 

\STARKSOLDIERa: Whoa, whoa. Who do you fight for? 

\BRIENNE: The Starks. \sd{\BRIENNE ~starts to untie \JAIME.} 

\STARKSOLDIERb: What did he do? 

\JAIME: \sd{Adopting a rather less noble accent.} Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew? 

\BRIENNE: No, stealing is a crime. 

\JAIME: But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: Where are you taking him? 

\BRIENNE: To Riverrun. 

\STARKSOLDIERb: Why Riverrun? 

\BRIENNE: Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in. 

\STARKSOLDIERb: Why not kill him? 

\JAIME: For stealing a pig? 

\BRIENNE: I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: Sending him with you? How important could he be? All right, have it your way, m'lady. 

\STARKSOLDIERb: \sd{To \JAIME.} Do I know you? 

\JAIME: Have you been to Ashemark? 

\STARKSOLDIERb: No. 

\JAIME: Then you don't know me. 

\STARKSOLDIERb: Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock? 

\JAIME: Is it near Ashemark?

\STARKSOLDIERb: No. 

\JAIME: I've never been there. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: What do you think of these beauties? 

\ti{\BRIENNE ~pauses and looks back, as does \JAIME.}

\BRIENNE: I hope you gave them quick deaths. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: Two of them we did, yeah. 

\ti{\BRIENNE ~turns and starts walking again, pushing \JAIME ~in front of her.}

\STARKSOLDIERb: Wait. \sd{Walking up to \JAIME ~again.} I do know you. \sd{To \STARKSOLDIERa.} That's Jaime Lannister. 

\JAIME: I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig. 

\BRIENNE: If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it. 

\STARKSOLDIERa: How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like? 

\STARKSOLDIERb: I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King. 

\BRIENNE: He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head. 

\STARKSOLDIERb: I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.

\ti{Beat. \BRIENNE ~pushes \JAIME ~away and \BRIENNE
~and \textbf{STARK SOLDIERS} fight. \JAIME ~watches from the
side. \STARKSOLDIERb ~is quickly killed. \STARKSOLDIERa ~is disarmed
and knocked to the ground. He lies on the ground as \BRIENNE ~drops
her knives, and pulls out her sword.}

\BRIENNE: Two quick deaths. 

\ti{\BRIENNE ~provides \STARKSOLDIERa ~with a very slow death indeed.}

\JAIME: Those were Stark men. 

\BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told her I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.

\textit{ROBB'S CAMP} 

\ti{\ROBB ~is seated in his tent, and \CATELYN ~sits down near him.}

\CATELYN: Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross. 

\ROBB: I know that. 

\CATELYN: And you mean to do it anyway? 

\ROBB: I love her. 

\CATELYN: I know that seems important to you. 

\ROBB: It is important to me. 

\CATELYN: Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer. 

\ROBB: And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had? 

\CATELYN: Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting? 

\ROBB: Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it. 

\CATELYN: And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing$\ldots$  

\ROBB: My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.

\ti{Exit \ROBB.}

\textit{DRAGONSTONE} 

\ti{\STANNIS ~and \MELISANDRE ~stand with their backs to each other.}

\STANNIS: You said you saw my victory in the flames. 

\MELISANDRE: I did. I still see it. 

\STANNIS: The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. \sd{\MELISANDRE ~walks around until she is in front of \STANNIS ~} I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me? 

\MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses. 

\STANNIS: You claimed to speak for a god. 

\MELISANDRE: Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle? 

\STANNIS: You talk about war as if you understand it. 

\MELISANDRE: I've been fighting far longer than you. 

\STANNIS: Have you? Show me how you fight. \sd{Putting hands round \MELISANDRE's ~neck and choking her.} Show me. Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god? 

\MELISANDRE: Inside you. 

\ti{\STANNIS ~lets \MELISANDRE ~go, and she collapses to the floor, as he walks away, his back to her again.}

\STANNIS: I murdered my brother. 

\ti{\MELISANDRE ~stands and approaches \STANNIS.}

\MELISANDRE: We murdered him. Share the weight with me. 

\STANNIS: He wasn't your brother. 

\MELISANDRE: \sd{Next to \STANNIS ~and stroking his neck and shoulders.} This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be King. 

\STANNIS: You promise these things, but$\ldots$ you don't know. None of us know. 

\MELISANDRE: Let me show you. \sd{Walking towards one of the fires, pulling \STANNIS ~with her, by the hand.} Look into the fire, my King. Look. 

\STANNIS: I see fire. 

\MELISANDRE: Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my King? 

\ti{\STANNIS ~stares deeply into the flames.}

\STANNIS: Yes.

\textit{WINTERFELL} 

\sfx Horns

\ti{\THEON ~sits opposite a fire in his room. \LUWIN ~stands in the doorway.}

\THEON: I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall. 

\LUWIN: They want you to know you're surrounded. 

\THEON: I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded. 

\LUWIN: They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before---  

\THEON: Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me. No word from my father? 

\LUWIN: No. 

\THEON: Send more ravens. 

\LUWIN: You killed all the ravens. 

\THEON: The first time I saw Winterfell--- 

\sfx{Horns sound} 

\THEON: The first time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. We never stood a chance against a man who lives here. 

\LUWIN: Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home. 

\THEON: Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father---

\sfx{Horns sound} 

\THEON: I will kill that man. I swear it to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man. 

\LUWIN: Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you. 

\THEON: And what's your counsel, trusted friend? 

\LUWIN: Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run. 

\THEON: There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family. 

\LUWIN: Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch. Once a man has taken the Black$\ldots$ he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven. 

\THEON: I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates. 

\LUWIN: There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck$\ldots$ the Night's Watch is an ancient, honourable order. You'll have opportunities there. 

\THEON: The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep. 

\LUWIN: The opportunity to make amends for what you've done. 

\THEON: I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing. 

\LUWIN:  I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet. 

\THEON: You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

\sfx Horn.

\ti{\THEON ~stands on a wall with his sword out, surrounded by his \IRONBORN ~below, including \LORREN ~and \DAGMER.}

\THEON: You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.  They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland. 

\IRONBORN: Aye! 

\THEON: You think they're right? 

\IRONBORN: Aye. 

\THEON: We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman, and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr; Wex and Urzen; Stygg and Black Lorren$\ldots$  Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle. 

\ti{\THEON, who so isn't Henry V, descends from the wall, joining the \IRONBORN ~in the courtyard. \DAGMER ~is behind him}

\IRONBORN: Aye! 

\THEON: Mothers will name their sons for us. 

\IRONBORN: Aye! 

\THEON: Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them. 

\IRONBORN: Aye! 

\sfx Horn sounds.

\THEON: And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke! 

\IRONBORN: Aye! 

\THEON: What is dead may never die! 

\IRONBORN: What is dead may never die! 

\ti{\THEON ~raises his sword and gives a Mighty Battle Cry.}

\ti{\DAGMER ~clocks \THEON ~on the head with the stick of his spear, and \THEON ~collapses.}

\LORREN: Thought he'd never shut up. 

\DAGMER: It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt. 

\ti{Enter \LUWIN.}

\LUWIN: What is this? What are you doing? 

\ti{\DAGMER ~stabs \LUWIN ~with his spear.}

\DAGMER: \sd{To \LORREN ~and the rest of the \IRONBORN.} Let's go home. Come on.

\ti{\TYRION ~is lying in his bed. \VARYS ~sits near him. \PODRICK ~stands by the door.}

\TYRION: Why should I believe you? 

\VARYS: Why would I lie about it? 

\TYRION: To create strife between my sister and me. 

\VARYS: Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your Squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man. 

\TYRION: Pod. 

\PODRICK: Yes, My Lord? 

\TYRION: Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? 

\PODRICK: No, My Lord. 

\TYRION: You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal Goldcloaks outside my door at all times. 

\ti{\PODRICK ~makes as if to go.}

\VARYS: I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The Goldcloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak. 

\TYRION: Then my hill tribesmen. 

\ti{\PODRICK ~starts to leave again.}

\VARYS: Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, My Lord. 

\TYRION: Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends. 

\VARYS: We are. Podrick, would you mind? 

\ti{\PODRICK ~opens the door as \VARYS ~rises. \SHAE ~enters and sits on the bed by \TYRION. \VARYS ~starts to leave.}
 
\VARYS: \sd{To \TYRION.} There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The King won't give you any honours, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget. Come along now, Podrick. 

\ti{Exit \VARYS ~and \PODRICK.}

\SHAE: My love. 

\TYRION: It was good of you to come. 

\SHAE: Good of me? Of course I come. 

\ti{\SHAE ~reaches towards the bandage on \TYRION's face, and he pushes her hand away.}

\SHAE: I want to see you. 

\TYRION: Believe me, you don't. 

\SHAE: Have you looked? I will be the first. 

\ti{\SHAE ~unwraps \TYRION's bandages. He has a scar running diagonally across his face.}

\TYRION: Well? 

\SHAE: \sd{Gently.} You are a mess. 

\TYRION: I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double. 

\SHAE: You think I'm here for money? 

\TYRION: That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me. 

\SHAE: Aw, I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave. 

\TYRION: Leave? 

\SHAE: Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers$\ldots$ you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here. 

\TYRION: What would we do in Pentos? 

\SHAE: Eat, drink, fuck, live. 

\TYRION: I want to go with you.

\NARRATOR: Daenerys wanders through dark corridors in the House of the Undying, holding a torch and following the sound of dragons. She approaches a door, listening for dragons, and then pushes it open. She enters a round, empty chamber, with a large stone table at the centre, and doorways all around the room. She looks around, trying to identify where the dragon noises are coming from.\\
She chooses one of the doors, and walks through it, into the Great Hall. It is covered in snow, which is still falling through the ruined ceiling. Daenerys places the torch down and looks up at the ruined hall, before slowly approaching the Iron Throne. She reaches out$\ldots$ and then hearing the sound of dragons again, she walks away, following the sound.\\
As Daenerys walks, a large door in front of her slides upwards, and she walks through$\ldots$ and is now outside the Wall. There is too much snow to easily see, but she makes out a tent in the distance and heads towards it.\\
Entering the tent, Daenerys is now in the tent of Drogo, who sits holding a child
